As an example, the tutorial introduces a macro that permanently highlights revisions marked with the Track Changes feature in red within the document. This allows a document to be, for example, resubmitted to a journal without Track Changes enabled while keeping the revisions clearly highlighted. The guide is written for macOS, but the workflow is very similar for Windows.

Verify: The Developer tab should now be visible in the Word toolbar at the top of the window. Once the Developer tab is enabled, you’re ready to start working with macros! Proceed to the next chapter to learn how to create and run your first macro. "],["sample-manuscript.html", "3 Sample Manuscript", " 3 Sample Manuscript Before running the macro, you’ll need a sample manuscript loaded into Word. Below is a short example of an imaginary manuscript with tracked changes. Copy and paste this text into a new Word document: Sample Manuscript: Write the original version: “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.” At this point, enable Track Changes: Edit with Track Changes enabled followingly: “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy cat.” Inserted: “An agile fox leapt swiftly.” Once you’ve pasted this sample into Word, ensure Track Changes is turned on and visible. Now proceed with adding and running the macro as described in the next section.

This macro highlights insertions marked by Track Changes in red. 4.1 Open the VBA Editor Ensure the Developer tab is enabled (see Chapter 1 if it isn’t). Click on the Developer tab in the Word toolbar. Click on the Visual Basic icon. 4.2 Add the Macro Code In the VBA Editor, locate your Word document in the Project Explorer panel on the left. If the Project Explorer is not visible, click View &gt; Project Explorer. Right-click on the document name (e.g., ThisDocument) and select Insert &gt; Module. A new module window will open. Copy and paste the following code into the module, which is referenced from this post on SuperUser, courtesy of Stack Exchange Inc. (with user contributions licensed under CC BY-SA): Sub MarkChanges() Dim arev As Revision With ActiveDocument For Each arev In .Revisions If arev.Type = wdRevisionInsert Then arev.Range.Font.Color = RGB(255, 0, 56) End If Next arev End With End Sub Close the VBA Editor by clicking the X in the top-left corner (on Mac) or pressing Command + Q (macOS) / Alt + Q (Windows). 4.3 Run the Macro You have now returned to the Word Document. Click on the Developer tab and select Macros. In the Macros dialog box: Find the macro named MarkChanges in the list. Click Run. 4.4 Accept All Changes After running the macro, all text insertions marked by Track Changes in your sample manuscript will be displayed in red. This might not be immediately apparent, as Track Changes is still enabled. However, when you click Accept All Changes and Stop Tracking, the effect of the macro will become visible. 4.5 Verify the Results Once the macro has been run and the changes accepted, your document should now display all insertions in red, as shown in the screenshot below. Congratulations! You’ve successfully run the MarkChanges macro. This approach makes revisions permanent and visually distinct, even after turning off Track Changes.
