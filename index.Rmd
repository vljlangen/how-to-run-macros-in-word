# Introduction

This is a simple tutorial on how to run macros in Microsoft Word.

As an example, the tutorial introduces a macro that permanently highlights revisions marked with the Track Changes feature in red within the document. This allows a document to be, for example, resubmitted to a journal without Track Changes enabled while keeping the revisions clearly highlighted.

The guide is written for macOS, but the workflow is very similar for Windows.
